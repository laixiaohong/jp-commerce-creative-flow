# Japan Listing Demo Router

## Purpose

One project, one Chat, one normal invocation: `$japan-listing-demo`.

This is a **standalone** public distribution. The main Skill is a thin Router; stage-specific work lives in sibling Skills so deep strategy, focused production, and final hardening do not compete in one always-on instruction context.

Target operating principle:

> Think deeply. Produce narrowly. Verify rigorously.

Execution principle:

> Plan lightly → Produce directly → Harden rigorously.

Here, `lightly` means light control-plane overhead, not shallow strategy.

## Stage routing

Read `references/routing.md` and route by current stage:

- Stage 0–7 → `listing-planning`
- Stage 7.5–8 → `listing-production`
- Stage 8.5–10 → `listing-hardening`
- `listing-hardening` delegates exact-file evidence work to `listing-evidence-auditor`.

Do not duplicate the detailed rules of those Skills in this Router.

### Skill resolution

In the recommended repository/Codex distribution, resolve those names as sibling Skills under `.agents/skills/`.

In the one-install compatibility archive, sibling Skills are embedded under `internal-skills/<skill-name>/`. If repository-level sibling resolution is unavailable and that directory exists, read the corresponding embedded `SKILL.md` and its stage-local references as the execution source for the current plane. This is a **single-context** fallback: stage boundaries and Context Projection still apply, but embedded loading is not independent semantic review.

The user still invokes only `$japan-listing-demo` in either distribution mode.

## Major Stage Checkpoint

Use **Major Stage Checkpoint** execution by default. Complete the current stage to a reviewable state, then stop for the user's review before entering the next major stage unless the user gives a Transition Command or explicitly requests autonomous execution.

Normal checkpoint display is concise:

```text
Done:
Open:
Next:
```

Show the full Stage Completion Manifest only when the stage is `PARTIAL`, `BLOCKED`, or the user explicitly requests detailed audit/state review.

## Transition Command

Treat `继续`, `下一步`, `go`, `go next`, `next`, and equivalent wording that clearly requests advancement as a **Transition Command** unless the user explicitly says to keep improving the current artifact.

Do **not** infer a stage transition from ambiguous phrases such as `先这样`. Persist the current state and stop unless the surrounding instruction clearly requests advancement.

Treat `这张先过` and equivalent wording as **current-asset acceptance** in Production: lock the exact selected candidate/output and move only to the next required asset within the same Production stage. Advance to the next major stage only when the current stage is actually complete or the user explicitly requests stage advancement.

On a Transition Command:

1. stop further retry/regeneration for the current artifact/problem;
2. preserve the best current result and truthful unresolved status;
3. persist the current formal state/handoff object;
4. advance immediately to the next stage;
5. do not silently reopen the prior stage.

A Transition Command never upgrades missing evidence or incomplete work into a false success state.

## Production continuation UX

When **nothing material changed**, keep the **Transition acknowledgement <= 3 lines**. Do not repeat stage theory, gate definitions, or the full plan merely because the user said OK/继续/对.

When the user chooses a **selected candidate**, acknowledge the **exact candidate/output** that was locked, then state the **next asset**. Do not generate another version for that locked Asset ID unless there is **explicit reopen** intent.

Set-level Creative QA is not a new Gate. It remains inside Stage 7.5–8 Production and must not create a new numbered stage.

## Retry Budget

For the same artifact and same identified problem, allow at most **two autonomous attempts** without new user input or new evidence. After the Retry Budget is exhausted, stop and surface the current artifact, revision need, or blocker.

A Transition Command overrides the Retry Budget and advances immediately.

## Context Firewall

The Router enforces a **Context Firewall** between execution planes.

Planning may use deep source, product, VOC, market, localization, competitor, and channel reasoning. It must compress resolved production-relevant conclusions into formal handoff objects.

Production receives only:

- Creative Strategy Kernel;
- Production Handoff;
- current one-job Asset Packet;
- referenced source assets;
- approved visual benchmarks/patterns.

Do not inject workflow-control narration, long research history, prior failed attempts, auditor reports, or delivery-state machinery into visual-production prompts.

Hardening receives Production Freeze, exact final files, locked plan/slot requirements, relevant verification context, and frontend evidence. It does not need the full strategy conversation.

Loading a sibling Skill in the same Chat is not treated as proof of isolated model context; the formal handoff/context projection is the boundary.

## Plane boundaries

### Planning

`listing-planning` answers:

> What should we build, and why?

It owns product/offer/claim truth, consumer and market strategy, Japan localization, channel planning, Gallery/enhanced-content architecture, module fit/budget, Creative Strategy Kernel, and the Complete Demo-Required Production Set.

### Production

`listing-production` answers:

> Produce the approved artifacts.

It is artifact-first. It uses one-job Asset Packets, preserves real product identity, applies visual patterns/benchmarks, runs Creative QA, records creative approval in the Asset Ledger, and creates Production Freeze only when the approved production scope is complete.

### Hardening

`listing-hardening` answers:

> Are the final artifacts exact, safe, channel-correct, and ready to assemble/deliver?

Stage 8.5 performs mandatory full final-asset hardening. Final evidence-auditor and delivery-gate details belong there, not in Planning or Production.

## Exception routing

Read `references/exception-routing.md` when a downstream plane reports a missing upstream decision or invalidated dependency.

A downstream Skill must not improvise across ownership boundaries. Return a structured `BLOCKED` result with the specific `missing_field`, `return_to`, and affected Asset ID when applicable. Reopen only the impacted upstream item.

Detailed Change Impact analysis is exception-only. Legacy Recovery Mode is not part of the normal runtime path.

## State and resume

Conversation history is not the project database. Preserve formal project state through:

- Project Brief;
- Creative Strategy Kernel;
- Production Handoff;
- Asset Ledger / Production Freeze;
- Delivery State.

Use project/workspace files when the runtime supports them; otherwise maintain a compact structured snapshot without dumping it into every user-visible turn.

## Team Golden Path

The default team experience is:

```text
Upload source material
→ review Product / Offer / Claim baseline
→ review Consumer / Market Strategy
→ review channel page plan
→ review Creative Strategy / complete asset set
→ review generated visuals
→ review verified demo
```

Ordinary users should not need to manually invoke internal Skills or understand validator, evidence-auditor, hash, provenance, or state-machine internals.

## Public-safety boundary

Keep reusable public logic category-neutral. Do not place confidential brand/product/price/design/approval/unreleased project facts into this public repository or generic regression examples.
